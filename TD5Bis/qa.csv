5) What is the significance of TF-IDF?,tf–idf or TFIDF stands for term frequency–inverse document frequency. In information retrieval TFIDF is is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or in the collection of a set.
6) What is part of speech (POS) tagging?,According to The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group :
7) What is Lemmatization in NLP?,"Lemmatization generally means to do the things properly with the use of vocabulary and morphological analysis of words. In this process, the endings of the words are removed to return the base word, which is also known as Lemma."
9) What is tokenization in NLP?,Natural Language Processing aims to program computers to process large amounts of natural language data. Tokenization in NLP means the method of dividing the text into various tokens. You can think of a token in the form of the word. Just like a word forms into a sentence. It is an important step in NLP to slit the text into minimal units.
10) What is latent semantic indexing and where can it be applied?,Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) also called Latent semantic analysis is a mathematical method that was developed so that the accuracy of retrieving information can be improved. It helps in finding out the hidden(latent) relationship between the words(semantics) by producing a set of various concepts related to the terms of a sentence to improve the information understanding. The technique used for the purpose is called Singular value decomposition. It is generally useful for working on small sets of static documents.
12) Differentiate regular grammar and regular expression.,"Regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching. It includes the following elements:"
15) Explain Named entity recognition (NER)?,"Named-entity recognition (NER) is the method of extracting information.

These parse trees are useful in various applications like grammar checking or more importantly it plays a critical role in the semantic analysis stage.
25) What is pragmatic ambiguity in NLP?,Pragmatic Ambiguity can be defined as the words which have multiple interpretations. Pragmatic Ambiguity arises when the meaning of words of a sentence is not specific; it concludes different meanings. There are various sentences in which the proper sense is not understood due to the grammar formation of the sentence; this multi interpretation of the sentence gives rise to ambiguity.
26) What is perplexity in NLP?,"The word ""perplexed"" means ""puzzled"" or ""confused"", thus Perplexity in general means the inability to tackle something complicated and a problem that is not specified. Therefore, Perplexity in NLP is a way to determine the extent of uncertainty in predicting some text."

What Is Part Of Speech (pos) Tagging?,"According to The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group : Part Of Speech Tagger is a piece of software that reads text in some language and assigns parts of speech to each word (and other token), such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. PoS taggers use an algorithm to label terms in text bodies. These taggers make more complex categories than those defined as basic PoS, with tags such as “noun-plural” or even more complex labels. PoS is taught to school-age children in English grammar, where children perform basic PoS tagging as part of their education. "
What Is Pragmatic Analysis In Nlp?,"Pragmatic Analysis: It deals with outside word knowledge, which means knowledge that is external to the documents and/or queries.
